## Introduction
For everyone who wants to expand their network on LinkedIn but is too busy to send requests to hundreds of people manually, I have designed this Python code using **PyAutoGUI** in Python. 

## Pre-requisites
* This code is designed to work on Windows computer systems.
* You should be logged in to your LinkedIn web in **_chrome_** browser. (It may not work if you have other browsers.)
* You should have a dark theme set on the LinkedIn webpage.

## Working
This is a complete python based program which uses the PyAutoGUI module of python. This module is used to control your mouse and keyboard commands. One of the applications of PyAutoGUI is to automate actions of mouse and keyboard based on the content present on the screen which is being done in here. If you want to know more about PyAutoGUI, you can visit [this site](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## How to use
Before using this code you will need to an excel sheet with links to profile pages of people you wanna connect. The links must be put in a column without any empty cells between them. Also make sure you have all the pre-requisities. 

# Configuration of code
You can see the video below to visualize the working of the code in my personal system. This would help you configure the code easily.
