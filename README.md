## 0: Introduction
For everyone who wants to expand their network on LinkedIn but is too busy to send requests to hundreds of people manually. This bot can send connection requests to as many people as you want without requiring any external assistance, but you must occasionally monitor it. You can go through Section 2 to use this on your own device.

## 1: Working
This is a complete Python program that uses the PyAutoGUI module of Python. This module is used to control your mouse and keyboard commands. One of the applications of PyAutoGUI is to automate actions of the mouse and keyboard based on the content present on the screen, which is being done here. If you want to know more about PyAutoGUI, you can visit this [site](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## 2: Configuration of code
You can see the folder labeled "alpha_testing" to visualize and understand the workings of the code in my personal system. This would help you configure the code easily. Before configuring the code, make sure the prerequisites are met.

### 2.0: Pre-requisites
* This code is designed to work on Windows computer systems.
* You should be logged in to your LinkedIn web in **_chrome_** browser. (It will not work if you have any browsers other than Chrome.)
* You should have a dark theme set on the LinkedIn webpage. On how to switch, visit this [site](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a524473/switch-between-dark-and-light-mode#:~:text=To%20switch%20to%20either%20dark,under%20Display%2C%20click%20Dark%20mode.).

### 2.1: Google sheet
* Create a Google sheet and add all the links to LinkedIn profiles in one column. Make sure that there are no empty cells between two links in that column. Here is an example image.
