## Introduction
For everyone who wants to expand their network in linkedin but is too busy to manually send requests to hundreds of people, I have designed this python code using **PyAutoGUI** in python. 

## Pre-requisites
* This code is designed to work on windows computer systems.
* You should be logged in in your LinkedIn web in **_chrome_** browser. (Will not work if you have other browers.)
* You should have dark theme set in linkedIn webpage.
* Prepare an excel sheet with a list of profile links of everyone you want to connect placed in a column.

## Working
This is a complete python based program which uses the PyAutoGUI module of python. This module is used to control your mouse and keyboard commands. One of the main applications of PyAutoGUI is to automate actions of mouse and keyboard based on the content present on the screen which is being done in here.
