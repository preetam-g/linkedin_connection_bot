## 0: Introduction
For everyone who wants to expand their network on LinkedIn but is too busy to send requests to hundreds of people manually. This bot can send connection requests to as many people as you want without requiring any external assistance, but you must occassi0nally monitor it. You can go through section 2 to use this in your own device.

## 1: Working
This is a complete python based program which uses the PyAutoGUI module of python. This module is used to control your mouse and keyboard commands. One of the applications of PyAutoGUI is to automate actions of mouse and keyboard based on the content present on the screen which is being done in here. If you want to know more about PyAutoGUI, you can visit this [site](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## 2: Configuration of code
You can see the folder labeled "alpha_testing" to visualize and understand the working of the code in my personal system. This would help you configure the code easily. Before configuring the code, make sure the pre-requisites are met.

### 2.0: Pre-requisites
* This code is designed to work on Windows computer systems.
* You should be logged in to your LinkedIn web in **_chrome_** browser. (Will not work if you have any browsers other than chrome.)
