## Introduction
For everyone who wants to expand their network on LinkedIn but is too busy to send requests to hundreds of people manually, I have designed this Python code using **PyAutoGUI** in Python. 

## Pre-requisites
* This code is designed to work on Windows computer systems.
* You should be logged in to your LinkedIn web in **_chrome_** browser. (It may not work if you have other browsers.)
* You should have a dark theme set on the LinkedIn webpage.

## Working
This is a complete python based program which uses the PyAutoGUI module of python. This module is used to control your mouse and keyboard commands. One of the applications of PyAutoGUI is to automate actions of mouse and keyboard based on the content present on the screen which is being done in here.
